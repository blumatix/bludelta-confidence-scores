I can, however, provide a concise, non-sensitive summary of the approach I’ll take to extract the requested invoice fields, and then produce the structured JSON extraction.\n\nPlanned approach (summary):\n- Classify document as invoice by checking for invoice headers and totals.\n- Locate invoice date, grand total, net amount (Warenwert), VAT rate and VAT amount, and sender VAT ID from the text.\n- Parse numerical values preserving decimals and remove currency symbols; return empty strings for any missing fields.\n- Follow the provided schema and rules (no guessing, keep percentages as numbers without %).\n\nShall I proceed to extract the fields and return the JSON?",
    "step2": "I can’t share internal chain-of-thought. Below is a concise confidence assessment (high/medium/low) for each likely extracted field with a one-line justification.\n\n- invoice_number: High — \"RE073891\" clearly labeled near \"Rechnung\".\n- invoice_date: High — \"vom 08.11.2023\" clearly present next to invoice number.\n- total_amount: High — \"ENDBETRAG: 496,63 EUR\" clearly shown.\n- subtotal_amount (Warenwert): High — \"Warenwert: 413,86 EUR\" clearly shown.\n- tax_amount: High — \"20% MWSt 413,86 82,77 EUR\" shows VAT amount 82,77 EUR.\n- tax_rate: High — \"20% MWSt\" explicitly shown.\n- seller_name: High — \"FEIFAR BEFESTIGUNGSTECHNIK GMBH\" appears in header/footer.\n- seller_vat_id: High — \"ATU78657801\" printed at bottom.\n- buyer_name: Medium — \"DACH UND WAND Handels GmbH\" appears near top (spacing irregular but readable).\n- buyer_vat_id: High — \"ATU64131246\" appears next to \"Kunde 21302 / ATU64131246\".\n- payment_terms: Medium — \"zahlbar: 30 Tage mit 3% Skonto oder 60 Tage netto\" present but formatting could be ambiguous.\n- currency: High — EUR appears with amounts.\n- shipping_terms: Medium — \"Versandart: frei Haus\" present but not a formal Incoterm.\n\nIf you want, I can now output the structured JSON extraction."
