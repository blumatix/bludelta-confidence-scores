    "step1": "{\n  \"GrandTotal.Amount\": 2944.36,\n  \"Invoice.Date\": \"29-01-2024\",\n  \"Sender.VatId\": \"ATU22642807\",\n  \"Vat.Rate\": 10,\n  \"Net.Amount\": 2676.69,\n  \"Vat.Amount\": 267.67\n}",
    "step2": "I'll evaluate each extracted field with evidence, possible alternatives, and confidence.\n\n1) GrandTotal.Amount = 2944.36\n- Evidence: The text shows \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" which matches 2,944.36 in standard decimal notation.\n- Consistency: Net 2,676.69 + VAT 267.67 = 2,944.36 — sums exactly.\n- Alternatives/uncertainty: Comma used as decimal (European format) parsed correctly. No other total visible.\n- Confidence: Very high.\n\n2) Invoice.Date = \"29-01-2024\"\n- Evidence: The line \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" appears near the header; typical invoice date placement.\n- Consistency: Other dates present (order 22-01-2024, delivery 23-01-2024) but 29-01-2024 is clearly labeled with city, consistent with invoice date.\n- Alternatives/uncertainty: Could be invoice issuance date vs. another date, but most likely invoice date.\n- Confidence: High.\n\n3) Sender.VatId = \"ATU22642807\"\n- Evidence: Text contains \"ATU22642807\" near \"Zahlung\" block and also earlier a different UID \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" appears later; the extracted value corresponds to the standalone line \"ATU22642807\".\n- Consistency: Two VAT/UID numbers present: ATU22642807 and ATU43349701. Which is sender's VAT? The header shows company SENNA; the later \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" seems associated with company registration info. The standalone ATU22642807 appears in invoice area (just above payment terms) — ambiguous.\n- Alternatives/uncertainty: Could be customer or intermediary VAT; more likely sender's VAT is the \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" (explicit label). Therefore extracted ATU22642807 may be incorrect.\n- Confidence: Low–moderate.\n\n4) Vat.Rate = 10\n- Evidence: The line \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" is printed, indicating 10% VAT rate.\n- Consistency: VAT amount 267.67 is 10% of 2,676.69 — matches.\n- Alternatives/uncertainty: None significant.\n- Confidence: Very high.\n\n5) Net.Amount = 2676.69\n- Evidence: \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" appears; matches Net.Amount.\n- Consistency: Net + VAT equals grand total.\n- Alternatives/uncertainty: Could be subtotal vs. taxable base after discounts, but text labels it as Auftragssumme (order sum) — used as net.\n- Confidence: Very high.\n\n6) Vat.Amount = 267.67\n- Evidence: VAT line shows \"267,67\" next to the 10% label.\n- Consistency: 10% of 2,676.69 = 267.669 → rounded to 267.67, matches.\n- Alternatives/uncertainty: Rounding consistent.\n- Confidence: Very high."
