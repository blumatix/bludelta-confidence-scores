    "step2": "I'll evaluate each extracted field with step-by-step confidence reasoning.\n\n1) GrandTotal.Amount = 2944.36\n- Evidence: The invoice shows \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" (German formatting comma as decimal). That matches 2,944.36 EUR.\n- Consistency check: Net 2,676.69 + VAT 267.67 = 2,944.36 — math matches.\n- Ambiguities: None significant; currency clearly EUR.\nConfidence: Very high (≈98%).\n\n2) Invoice.Date = \"29-01-2024\"\n- Evidence: Header area shows \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" next to the invoice/Gutschrift info. That is the only full date in the header context.\n- Ambiguities: Could be document issue date vs. delivery date; user asked for \"Invoice.Date\" — using the header date is standard.\nConfidence: High (≈95%).\n\n3) Sender.VatId = \"ATU22642807\"\n- Evidence: Text includes \"ATU22642807\" prominently (preceded by nothing or \"ATU22642807\" line). Also elsewhere \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" appears — there are two ATU numbers in the document.\n- Ambiguities: The invoice shows two UID/ATU numbers: ATU22642807 (isolated near totals) and \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" further down. Which is the sender VAT? The company Senna likely has one VAT; need to determine which is correct. The extracted value ATU22642807 appears directly above \"Zahlung:\" block — likely the seller's VAT. But presence of another UID indicates possible buyer/seller mix or different IDs (maybe Bäko's UID). This reduces certainty.\nConfidence: Moderate (≈65%).\n\n4) Vat.Rate = 10 (%)\n- Evidence: Near totals it shows \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\".\n- Ambiguities: None obvious.\nConfidence: Very high (≈99%).\n\n5) Net.Amount = 2676.69\n- Evidence: \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" and shown as base amount before VAT; matches the net used in the skonto calculation.\n- Consistency check: Net + VAT = GrandTotal, and 2% cash discount calculation shown uses a base near this number.\n- Ambiguities: Could be gross vs net labeling confusion, but context indicates net.\nConfidence: Very high (≈98%).\n\n6) Vat.Amount = 267.67\n- Evidence: Listed near totals as \"267,67\" next to the 10% VAT line.\n- Consistency check: 10% of 2,676.69 = 267.669 → rounded to 267.67, matches.\n- Ambiguities: None significant.\nConfidence: Very high (≈99%)."
