    "step2": "I will evaluate each extracted field with step-by-step reasoning and an estimated confidence level.\n\n1) GrandTotal.Amount = 2944.36\n- Evidence: The text shows \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" (German formatting uses comma as decimal separator). That matches 2,944.36 EUR.\n- Internal consistency: Net 2,676.69 + VAT 267.67 = 2,944.36, consistent.\n- Potential ambiguity: None apparent.\n- Confidence: 98%\n\n2) Invoice.Date = \"29-01-2024\"\n- Evidence: The header area shows \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" which is the document date/location; this is typically the invoice/credit note date.\n- Potential ambiguity: Could be document issuance date vs. delivery date; but user asked for \"Invoice.Date\" and this is the most likely invoice date.\n- Confidence: 92%\n\n3) Sender.VatId = \"ATU22642807\"\n- Evidence: The block near bottom contains \"ATU22642807\" labeled (preceded by) same area as other tax/company IDs; also \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" appears elsewhere â€” need to check both.\n- Ambiguity: There are two ATU numbers present: \"ATU22642807\" (isolated) and later \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\". Which is the sender VAT? The extracted value was ATU22642807 found near the section above payment terms; the \"UID-Nr.\" explicitly labels ATU 43349701 which might be the company UID. Hard to be 100% certain which is sender VAT. Given typical placement, \"ATU22642807\" appears alone and likely corresponds to sender VAT, but presence of UID-Nr. introduces doubt.\n- Confidence: 70%\n\n4) Vat.Rate = 10\n- Evidence: The invoice shows \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" next to VAT line.\n- Internal consistency: VAT amount 267.67 is 10% of 2,676.69 -> 267.669 -> rounded 267.67, consistent.\n- Potential ambiguity: None.\n- Confidence: 98%\n\n5) Net.Amount = 2676.69\n- Evidence: The line \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" appears and Net used to compute VAT equals this amount.\n- Internal consistency: Net + VAT = GrandTotal matches.\n- Potential ambiguity: Could be pre-discount or after discounts; but matches visible \"Auftragssumme\".\n- Confidence: 96%\n\n6) Vat.Amount = 267.67\n- Evidence: The invoice shows \"267,67\" adjacent to \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\".\n- Internal consistency: 10% of 2,676.69 = 267.669 -> rounded to 267.67, matches.\n- Potential ambiguity: Rounding correct.\n- Confidence: 98%"
