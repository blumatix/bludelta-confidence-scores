    "step1": "I will not provide internal chain-of-thought. Instead, here is a concise, non-sensitive description of the stepwise extraction approach I will use:\n\n- Verify document is an invoice: check for invoice indicators (“Rechnung”, invoice number, totals, line items) and ensure exclusion terms (“Mahnung”, “Zahlungserinnerung”) do not dominate.\n- Locate and extract explicit fields only (no guessing):\n  - Invoice.Date: find the labeled date near invoice number.\n  - GrandTotal.Amount: find the final payable amount labeled ENDBETRAG or equivalent (preserve decimals).\n  - Sender.VatId: find sender VAT/Tax ID (labeled ATU...).\n  - Vat.Rate: find VAT percentage shown (remove “%” in output).\n  - Net.Amount: find Warenwert / net amount before VAT (preserve decimals).\n  - Vat.Amount: find the VAT amount line (preserve decimals).\n- If any field is not explicitly present, return an empty string for that field (no inference).\n- Maintain original number formatting and decimal places.\n- If multiple occurrences of a detail appear, include each occurrence according to schema rules (but only apply where schema allows).\n- Ensure exchange-rate and line-item-only conversions are ignored (not applicable here).\n\nI will now proceed to extract the fields according to this approach.",
    "step2": "Sorry — I can’t share internal chain-of-thought. Below is a brief, non-sensitive confidence summary for each extracted field (concise justification only).\n\n- Invoice number: RE073891 — High. Visible next to “Rechnung” and “vom”.\n- Invoice date: 08.11.2023 — High. Appears adjacent to invoice number as “vom 08.11.2023”.\n- Seller name: FEIFAR BEFESTIGUNGSTECHNIK GMBH — High. Prominently printed as sender.\n- Seller VAT ID: ATU78657801 — High. Clearly labeled near company footer.\n- Buyer/customer number: 21302 — Medium-High. Shown next to “Kunde” but formatting could combine other IDs.\n- Buyer VAT ID: ATU64131246 — High. Shown next to customer info.\n- Net amount (Warenwert): 413,86 EUR — High. Labeled “Warenwert” with currency.\n- VAT rate: 20% — High. Explicitly shown as “20% MWSt”.\n- VAT amount: 82,77 EUR — High. Shown next to VAT line.\n- Total (ENDBETRAG): 496,63 EUR — High. Clearly labeled “ENDBETRAG”.\n- Payment terms: “30 Tage mit 3% Skonto oder 60 Tage netto” — Medium-High. Text present but could be interpreted variably for due-date field.\n- Line items: 5 items (positions 1–5) with individual quantities/prices — Medium. Items are listed clearly, but OCR layout may obscure some fields (e.g., unit vs. total)."
