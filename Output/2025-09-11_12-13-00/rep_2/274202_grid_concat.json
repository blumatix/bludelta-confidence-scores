    "step1": "{\n  \"GrandTotal.Amount\": 2944.36,\n  \"Invoice.Date\": \"29-01-2024\",\n  \"Sender.VatId\": \"ATU22642807\",\n  \"Vat.Rate\": 10,\n  \"Net.Amount\": 2676.69,\n  \"Vat.Amount\": 267.67\n}",
    "step2": "I'll evaluate each extracted field with supporting evidence and a confidence estimate.\n\n1) GrandTotal.Amount = 2944.36\n- Evidence: The text shows \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" which matches 2,944.36 EUR (comma as decimal). Clear, unambiguous.\n- Consistency: Net 2,676.69 + VAT 267.67 = 2,944.36, matches.\n- Confidence: 98%\n\n2) Invoice.Date = \"29-01-2024\"\n- Evidence: The header area includes \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" which is the only explicit date formatted like an invoice date. There is also a delivery/other date 22-01-2024 and 23-01-2024, but 29-01-2024 is clearly positioned near the top/right and labeled with place, consistent with invoice date.\n- Ambiguity: minor (could be document date vs posting), but likely invoice date.\n- Confidence: 92%\n\n3) Sender.VatId = \"ATU22642807\"\n- Evidence: The string \"ATU22642807\" appears standalone under invoice area; also elsewhere \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" appears, so two different VAT-like numbers exist. The extracted value ATU22642807 is present in the document (above payment terms). Which is the sender? The company is SENNA—its VAT likely ATU22642807 or ATU43349701. The placement of ATU22642807 near payment/Skonto lines suggests it's the sender VAT, but presence of \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" indicates a different UID (maybe buyer or branch). Ambiguity exists.\n- Confidence: 60%\n\n4) Vat.Rate = 10 (percent)\n- Evidence: Text shows \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" directly above amounts.\n- Consistency: VAT amount corresponds (10% of 2,676.69 = 267.669 → rounded 267.67).\n- Confidence: 98%\n\n5) Net.Amount = 2676.69\n- Evidence: \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" and referred to as net before VAT. Matches calculation used.\n- Ambiguity: none significant.\n- Confidence: 96%\n\n6) Vat.Amount = 267.67\n- Evidence: Line shows \"267,67\" adjacent to VAT line. Matches 10% of net rounded to cents.\n- Confidence: 97%\n\nOverall note: main uncertainty is which VAT/UID belongs to the sender vs recipient due to two UID numbers on the page (ATU22642807 and ATU43349701)."
