    "step1": "{\n  \"GrandTotal.Amount\": 2944.36,\n  \"Invoice.Date\": \"29-01-2024\",\n  \"Sender.VatId\": \"ATU22642807\",\n  \"Vat.Rate\": 10,\n  \"Net.Amount\": 2676.69,\n  \"Vat.Amount\": 267.67\n}",
    "step2": "I'll evaluate each extracted field with step-by-step confidence reasoning.\n\n1) GrandTotal.Amount = 2944.36\n- Evidence: The OCR shows \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" near bottom. Comma as decimal separator -> 2.944,36 = 2944.36 EUR.\n- Consistency: Net 2.676,69 + VAT 267,67 = 2.944,36 — arithmetic matches.\n- Confidence: Very high (≈ 98%).\n\n2) Invoice.Date = \"29-01-2024\"\n- Evidence: Text shows \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" on the header area next to other dates. That is the typical invoice date placement.\n- Ambiguity: There are other dates (order 22-01-2024, Lieferschein 23-01-2024). But \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" strongly indicates invoice/gutschrift date.\n- Confidence: High (≈ 95%).\n\n3) Sender.VatId = \"ATU22642807\"\n- Evidence: OCR shows \"ATU22642807\" on its own line (preceded by ATU maybe label). Also later another UID \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" appears — two different UIDs present.\n- Ambiguity: Which is sender VAT? The extracted value ATU22642807 appears above payment terms section likely associated with sender, but text also shows \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" (could be company or customer). Need to verify which belongs to SENNA (sender). The top left is SENNA company; the ATU22642807 is printed near payment/Skonto area — likely SENNA VAT. Still some ambiguity.\n- Confidence: Moderate (≈ 70%).\n\n4) Vat.Rate = 10\n- Evidence: Text shows \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" next to VAT amounts.\n- Ambiguity: None apparent.\n- Confidence: Very high (≈ 98%).\n\n5) Net.Amount = 2676.69\n- Evidence: \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" and earlier line showing amount 2.676,69 correspond to net sum before VAT.\n- Consistency: Matches VAT calculation (10% of 2676.69 = 267.669 -> rounded 267.67) and grand total.\n- Confidence: Very high (≈ 98%).\n\n6) Vat.Amount = 267.67\n- Evidence: Line shows \"267,67\" next to VAT column; matches 10% rounding from net.\n- Consistency: 2676.69 * 0.10 = 267.669 → rounded 267.67, and net + VAT = grand total.\n- Confidence: Very high (≈ 98%)."
