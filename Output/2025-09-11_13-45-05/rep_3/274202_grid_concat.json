Need to verify which is sender VAT. The earlier ATU22642807 appears near amounts and payment terms; the later \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" is in paragraph with company registration details. Unclear which belongs to sender. My extracted value was ATU22642807, but presence of two ATU numbers introduces ambiguity.\n- Confidence: Medium-low.\n\n4) Vat.Rate: 10 (%)\n- Evidence: Text shows \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" next to VAT line.\n- Consistency: Matches calculation (10% of 2,676.69 = 267.669 → rounded 267.67).\n- Confidence: High.\n\n5) Net.Amount: 2676.69\n- Evidence: Text shows \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" and the VAT calculation uses that as base.\n- Consistency: Matches VAT and grand total.\n- Confidence: Very high.\n\n6) Vat.Amount: 267.67\n- Evidence: Text shows \"267,67\" on VAT line.\n- Consistency: 10% of 2,676.69 = 267.669 → rounded 267.67; sums correctly.\n- Confidence: Very high."
