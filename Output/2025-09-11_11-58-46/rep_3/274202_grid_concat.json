    "step1": "1) Document classification\n- Looked for invoice indicators: found \"GUTSCHRIFT\" (credit note), \"Auftragssumme\", \"Endbetrag\", \"Mehrwertsteuer\", numeric totals, dates, VAT/UID numbers, line-item table — matches invoice-like document.  \n- No exclusion terms like \"Zahlungserinnerung\" or \"Mahnung\" prominently present.  \n- Conclusion: treat as invoice-like (credit note) and proceed with extraction.\n\n2) Identify candidate fields and verify exact text locations\n- Invoice.Date:\n  - Found \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" (document/date line). Also other dates: \"vom: 22-01-2024\" (order date) and \"vom 2024-01-23\" (delivery note). The document-level date is \"29-01-2024\". Candidate: \"29-01-2024\".\n- GrandTotal.Amount:\n  - Found \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" — total payable. Candidate numeric value: 2.944,36 (interpreted as 2944.36).\n- Net.Amount:\n  - Found \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" and line item sums showing 2.676,69. Candidate net amount: 2.676,69 (2676.69).\n- Vat.Rate:\n  - Found \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" adjacent to totals. Candidate VAT rate: 10 (per instruction, without percent sign).\n- Vat.Amount:\n  - Found \"267,67\" next to the VAT line (shown after the 10% line). Candidate VAT amount: 267,67 (267.67).\n- Sender.VatId:\n  - Two VAT-like entries present:\n    - \"ATU22642807\" (appears near the middle, isolated).\n    - \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" (later in text). Need to decide which is sender's VAT:\n      - Document header/company is \"SENNA Nahrungsmittel GmbH & CoKG\" — the isolated \"ATU22642807\" appears near totals and payment terms, likely the sender's VAT. \"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\" appears near \"Die Lieferung erfolgt ...\" line; could be another entity (possibly buyer). Prefer \"ATU22642807\" as Sender.VatId because it is directly listed near the company/payment section.\n  - Candidate Sender.VatId: \"ATU22642807\".\n\n3) Verify numeric formatting and no inference\n- Keep decimals as in input:\n  - Grand total written \"2.944,36\" -> numeric value should preserve two decimals: 2944.36.\n  - Net \"2.676,69\" -> 2676.69.\n  - Vat.Amount \"267,67\" -> 267.67.\n- Vat.Rate must be number without \"%\" -> 10.\n- Do not infer any missing fields; used only explicitly present values.\n\n4) Consider ambiguities and chosen resolutions\n- Multiple dates: chose document date \"29-01-2024\" as Invoice.Date rather than order/delivery dates.\n- Two VAT IDs: selected \"ATU22642807\" as sender VAT based on proximity to company/payment section; noted presence of second UID but did not select it.\n- Document is a credit note (\"GUTSCHRIFT\") but still invoice-like; proceed to extract.\n\n5) Fields determined to output (values identified to populate final JSON)\n- Invoice.Date -> \"29-01-2024\"\n- GrandTotal.Amount -> 2944.36\n- Net.Amount -> 2676.69\n- Vat.Rate -> 10\n- Vat.Amount -> 267.67\n- Sender.VatId -> \"ATU22642807\"\n\n(End of step-by-step reasoning; will not output final JSON yet as requested.)",
    "step2": "Invoice.Date — confidence: high (≈90%)\n- Evidence: explicit line \"Wien, 29-01-2024\" formatted like a document date.  \n- Ambiguity: other dates present (order 22-01-2024, delivery 2024-01-23), but placement and format strongly indicate document/invoice date.\n\nGrandTotal.Amount (2944.36) — confidence: high (≈92%)\n- Evidence: explicit \"Endbetrag EUR 2.944,36\" clearly the final amount due.  \n- Ambiguity: none significant; formatting conversion from \"2.944,36\" to numeric is straightforward.\n\nNet.Amount (2676.69) — confidence: high (≈90%)\n- Evidence: \"Auftragssumme 2.676,69\" shown above tax lines; matches line-item subtotal.  \n- Ambiguity: document is labeled \"GUTSCHRIFT\" (credit note) but numeric label and placement indicate net/subtotal.\n\nVat.Rate (10) — confidence: high (≈90%)\n- Evidence: displayed \"+ 10 % Mehrwertsteuer\" directly adjacent to totals.  \n- Ambiguity: none significant; percentage clearly printed.\n\nVat.Amount (267.67) — confidence: high (≈90%)\n- Evidence: the numeric \"267,67\" appears on the same line as tax calculation. 10% of 2,676.69 ≈ 267.669 → rounds to 267.67, consistent.  \n- Ambiguity: rounding conventions minor; text explicitly shows 267,67.\n\nSender.VatId (\"ATU22642807\") — confidence: medium (≈65%)\n- Evidence: \"ATU22642807\" appears near payment/terms area associated with the supplier section.  \n- Ambiguity: another UID appears later (\"UID-Nr.: ATU 43349701\"); unclear which corresponds to sender vs buyer. Placement suggests ATU22642807 is sender, but not unambiguous."
