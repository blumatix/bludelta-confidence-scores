    "step1": "I will not provide inner chain-of-thought. Below is a concise, non-sensitive plan and high-level rationale for extracting the required fields from the document.\n\n1. Document classification\n- Detect invoice indicators: presence of \"Rechnung\", invoice number (RE073891), invoice date (08.11.2023), totals and VAT lines. Conclusion: document is an invoice (no dominant exclusion terms).\n\n2. Validation of structured headers\n- Invoice header and totals section (\"Warenwert\", \"zuzüglich 20% MWSt\", \"ENDBETRAG\") present — proceed with extraction.\n\n3. Fields to extract and their source locations (high-level)\n- Invoice.Date: take the date shown near invoice number (\"vom 08.11.2023\").\n- GrandTotal.Amount: take the ENDBETRAG value (496,63 EUR) — numeric amount only.\n- Vat.Rate: take the VAT percentage shown in VAT line (\"20% MWSt\") — extract as number without % (20).\n- Net.Amount: take Warenwert (413,86 EUR) — numeric amount only.\n- Vat.Amount: take VAT monetary amount shown (82,77 EUR) — numeric amount only.\n- Sender.VatId: take sender VAT ID found in footer (ATU78657801).\n\n4. Numeric formatting rules\n- Preserve decimals and comma separators as in source; convert to numeric form consistent with schema (no currency symbol). VAT rate returned without %.\n\n5. No-inference rule\n- If any of the above exact items were missing, I would leave that field empty.",
    "step2": "I will not provide internal chain-of-thought. Below are concise confidence assessments for each extracted field with brief evidential notes.\n\n- Invoice.Date = 08.11.2023 — Confidence: 99%. Evidence: clearly printed next to invoice number with label \"vom 08.11.2023\".\n- Invoice.Number = RE073891 — Confidence: 99%. Evidence: clearly printed near top with label \"RE073891\".\n- GrandTotal.Amount = 496,63 EUR — Confidence: 99%. Evidence: labeled \"ENDBETRAG\" and numeric matches net + VAT.\n- Net.Amount (Warenwert) = 413,86 EUR — Confidence: 99%. Evidence: labeled \"Warenwert\" with that amount.\n- Vat.Rate = 20% — Confidence: 99%. Evidence: VAT line shows \"20% MWSt\".\n- Vat.Amount = 82,77 EUR — Confidence: 99%. Evidence: shown alongside VAT line and 413,86 + 82,77 = 496,63 (consistent).\n- Sender.VatId = ATU78657801 — Confidence: 98%. Evidence: appears in footer labeled as VAT ID; formatting and placement match standard.\n- Payment.Terms = \"30 Tage mit 3% Skonto oder 60 Tage netto\" — Confidence: 95%. Evidence: printed in payment conditions line; minor OCR noise risk but meaning clear.\n- Customer.ID = 21302 / ATU64131246 — Confidence: 90%. Evidence: appears near customer area as \"Kunde 21302 / ATU64131246\"; moderate OCR/label ambiguity potential.\n\nIf you want, I can now output the final structured JSON with these values."
