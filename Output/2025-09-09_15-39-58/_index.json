      "step1": "I will reason step-by-step about extracting the required fields from the provided invoice text. I will check invoice classification first, then identify and verify each schema field, note formats and any ambiguities, and confirm whether extraction is allowed under the rules (no inference, preserve decimals, percent without %).\n\n1) Document classification (invoice vs non-invoice)\n- Visible explicit invoice indicators: the header contains \"Rechnung\" and an invoice reference \"RE073891 vom 08.11.2023\". There are typical invoice elements: invoice number, invoice date, line items with quantities/prices/amounts, \"Warenwert\", \"MWSt\", \"ENDBETRAG\", payment terms, sender/company details including VAT-like IDs. No exclusion indicators (\"Zahlungserinnerung\", \"Mahnung\", \"Servicebericht\") appear. Conclusion: this is an invoice — proceed with extraction.\n\n2) Locate candidate values for each required field\n- Invoice.Date:\n  - Found: \"RE073891 vom 08.11.2023\" — date text \"08.11.2023\" appears clearly labeled with \"vom\". Candidate Invoice.Date = \"08.11.2023\".\n\n- GrandTotal.Amount:\n  - Found: \"ENDBETRAG: 496,63 EUR\" (right-aligned in totals area). Candidate GrandTotal.Amount = 496,63 (EUR currency present but schema expects numeric amount only). Must preserve decimal comma and same decimals as input. Schema type is number — decimal separator must be converted to conventional numeric format (but rules say keep decimal places as in input). Later decision: represent numeric value matching input precision. Note: developer rule 5 and 7: preserve decimals; rule 2 no inference. Keep as numeric with same decimals (will convert comma to dot for numeric type if required).\n\n- Net.Amount:\n  - Found: \"Warenwert: 413,86 EUR\" — this is the net amount (Warenwert) before VAT. Candidate Net.Amount = 413,86.\n\n- Vat.Rate:\n  - Found: \"zuzüglich 20% MWSt\" — VAT rate is 20%. Per rules, return rate without percentage symbol -> \"20\" (numeric).\n\n- Vat.Amount:\n  - Found: adjacent to VAT line: \"413,86 82,77 EUR\" — the layout shows the VAT amount 82,77 EUR corresponding to 20% of 413,86. Candidate Vat.Amount = 82,77.\n\n- Sender.VatId:\n  - In footer: \"ATU78657801\" appears near company details. At top right near customer line there is \"Kunde 21302 / ATU64131246\" — that ATU64131246 is likely the customer VAT ID, while the sender's VAT ID is ATU78657801 in footer next to company details. Schema field is Sender.VatId — choose the sender's VAT ID: ATU78657801. Candidate Sender.VatId = \"ATU78657801\".\n\n3) Verify presence and uniqueness, multiple occurrences rules\n- Invoice.Date: single clear occurrence \"08.11.2023\". Good.\n- GrandTotal.Amount: single clear \"ENDBETRAG: 496,63 EUR\". Good.\n- Net.Amount: \"Warenwert: 413,86 EUR\" is clearly net. Good.\n- Vat.Rate: single \"20% MWSt\" found. Good.\n- Vat.Amount: \"82,77 EUR\" adjacent to VAT line; single occurrence. Good.\n- Sender.VatId: two ATU numbers present: top shows \"Kunde ... / ATU64131246\" (customer VAT) and footer shows \"ATU78657801\" (company). Must pick sender's VAT = footer ATU78657801 per label near company details. This obeys rule 3 (multiple occurrences): return each occurrence only where appropriate; schema only has one Sender.VatId field so include the sender's one.\n\n4) Formatting and rule checks\n- No inference needed; each field exists explicitly.\n- Preserve decimal places exactly as in input (two decimals). The schema expects type number — will provide numeric values while preserving decimals. Developer rule 5: VAT rate must be returned without \"%\" -> \"20\" numeric.\n- Ensure not to include currency symbols in numeric fields (Net.Amount, Vat.Amount, GrandTotal.Amount). The input uses comma as decimal separator; numeric JSON typically uses dot. But rules say \"Keep the amount of decimals places the same as in the input. Do not truncate numbers.\" They do not forbid converting comma to dot for numeric type. Will convert to numeric representation preserving two decimal places (e.g., 496.63, 413.86, 82.77). If strict string required, schema types include number, so numeric with dot is appropriate.\n\n5) Any ambiguous or missing values?\n- All required fields are present and unambiguous:\n  - GrandTotal.Amount present.\n  - Invoice.Date present.\n  - Sender.VatId present.\n  - Vat.Rate present.\n  - Net.Amount present.\n  - Vat.Amount present.\n- No need to leave any required fields empty.\n\nConclusion of reasoning: the document is an invoice and all required schema fields can be extracted explicitly from the text with values:\n- Invoice.Date = \"08.11.2023\"\n- GrandTotal.Amount = 496,63 (will represent numerically as 496.63 preserving two decimals)\n- Net.Amount = 413,86 -> 413.86\n- Vat.Rate = 20 (number)\n- Vat.Amount = 82,77 -> 82.77\n- Sender.VatId = \"ATU78657801\"\n\nI will not output the final JSON yet per instructions.",
      "step2": "I will evaluate confidence for each extracted field with supporting evidence and any caveats.\n\nInvoice.Date = \"08.11.2023\"\n- Evidence: Explicit \"RE073891 vom 08.11.2023\" near top-right. Clear date format DD.MM.YYYY.\n- Ambiguity: None.\n- Confidence: 99%\n\nGrandTotal.Amount = 496.63\n- Evidence: Explicit \"ENDBETRAG: 496,63 EUR\" in totals block. Matches numeric sum of Net + VAT (see below).\n- Ambiguity: Minimal (comma->dot conversion for numeric representation).\n- Confidence: 99%\n\nNet.Amount = 413.86\n- Evidence: Explicit \"Warenwert: 413,86 EUR\" labeled as goods value (net).\n- Ambiguity: Low.\n- Confidence: 99%\n\nVat.Rate = 20\n- Evidence: Explicit \"zuzüglich 20% MWSt\" in totals area.\n- Ambiguity: None; returned without \"%\" per rules.\n- Confidence: 99%\n\nVat.Amount = 82.77\n- Evidence: Displayed near VAT line as \"82,77 EUR\". Arithmetic check: 20% of 413.86 = 82.772 → rounded/truncated to 82.77 as shown.\n- Ambiguity: Very small (rounding behavior matches printed value).\n- Confidence: 98%\n\nSender.VatId = \"ATU78657801\"\n- Evidence: Footer company block lists \"ATU78657801\" near FEIFAR company details (typical sender VAT placement). There is another ATU number in header (\"ATU64131246\") associated with \"Kunde\" (customer), so choice of sender vs customer is inferential but strongly indicated by layout.\n- Ambiguity: Some risk if one misinterprets which ATU corresponds to sender vs customer, but context (footer company info) supports sender assignment.\n- Confidence: 90%"
